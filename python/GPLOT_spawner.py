JOB SPAWNER FOR GPLOT MODULES

Description:  This is a template python script that is
    filled in automatially by the GPLOT Launcher. This script sorts out
    the jobs to run by checking a database. It then calls a simple shell
    script to submit jobs to the Slurm batch scheduler. Alternatively, the
    jobs can be run in the foreround/background.

GPLOT is the Graphical Post-processed Locus for Output of Tropical cyclones.
It consists of independent modules used to create graphics targeted toward
